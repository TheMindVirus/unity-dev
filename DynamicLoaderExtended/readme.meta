# Dynamic Library Loader Extended

A .asmdef file placed in a folder also containing a C# script causes the Windows Build Target \
to export a compiled shared library .dll version containing the binary contents of the C# Script \
for use in fixing missing scripts on AssetBundle `System.Reflection.Assembly.Load()` \
(but only for 1 script without saved parameters). Tabletop Simulator will oppose this for security.
